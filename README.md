# Store Order & Inventory Mini-System

A retail-counter billing app. The counter records customer orders against a product catalog, and stock stays in sync, including when two orders arrive at the same moment.

- **Backend:** Laravel 13 (PHP 8.3) JSON API, MySQL 8, database queue
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS 4, a separate app that talks to the API over CORS

## 1. Prerequisites

| Tool | Version used | Check with |
|---|---|---|
| PHP | 8.3+ with `pdo_mysql`, `mbstring`, `openssl` | `php -v`, `php -m` |
| Composer | 2.x | `composer -V` |
| MySQL | 8.x | `mysql --version` |
| Node.js / npm | Node 20.19+ (built on 24) / npm 10+ | `node -v`, `npm -v` |

## 2. Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env          # then set DB_USERNAME / DB_PASSWORD
php artisan key:generate
```

Create the two databases, one for the app and one for tests:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE `store-order-inventory-system`         CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE DATABASE `store-order-inventory-system_testing` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed    # 10 products (some already low on stock) + 10 customers
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## 3. Running

**One command, one terminal.** Run this from the repo root (the first time, run `npm install` there too):

```bash
npm run dev
```

It uses [concurrently](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently) to start all three processes with coloured, labelled output. Ctrl+C stops them all.

| Label | Process | URL / role |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | `php artisan serve` | http://localhost:8000 |
| `queue` | `php artisan queue:listen --tries=3` | sends the confirmation email + WhatsApp a few seconds after each bill |
| `web` | `npm --prefix frontend run dev` | http://localhost:5173 |

The worker is `queue:listen` rather than `queue:work` because it reloads the app for every job. Changes to code or `.env` apply without restarting anything, which is the right trade-off for development. In production use `queue:work` under a process manager (Supervisor, systemd, or NSSM on Windows) so it restarts on crash and at boot.

You can still run the three separately if you prefer: `npm run dev:api`, `npm run dev:queue` and `npm run dev:web`.

> Why not run the jobs inline (`QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync`)? Then no worker is needed, but every bill would wait for the email and WhatsApp APIs, and the brief asks for a *queued* job. The worker keeps billing instant, and failed sends are retried (3 attempts with backoff) and kept in `failed_jobs`.

Open **http://localhost:5173**. With the default `MAIL_MAILER=log`, the confirmation emails are written to `backend/storage/logs/laravel.log`.

**Sign in** with one of the seeded demo accounts. The password for all three is `password123`, and the login page has one-click buttons for them.

| Account | Role | Sees |
|---|---|---|
| `admin@store.test` | Admin | Everything, plus **Settings** (Users, Roles & Permissions, Password Reset) |
| `manager@store.test` | Store Manager | Dashboard, billing, orders, inventory (add/edit products, restock) |
| `cashier@store.test` | Cashier | Dashboard, billing and order history only |

Seeded customers you can try: `thomas@example.com` (mobile `5550001111`) and `priya@example.com` (mobile `5550002222`). Type either the mobile number or the email, and the other two fields fill in. The seeded numbers are deliberately not real, so test WhatsApp delivery with your own number.

### Optional: real email and WhatsApp

Both notifications work without any keys: the email goes to the log, and WhatsApp is skipped with a log warning. To send them for real, set these in `backend/.env`:

```env
# Email via Resend (composer package resend/resend-php is already installed)
MAIL_MAILER=resend
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxx
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="onboarding@resend.dev"   # Resend's test sender: delivers only to your own Resend account email

# WhatsApp via wasender.dev (https://wasender.dev)
WASENDER_API_TOKEN=wsk_xxxxxxxx
WASENDER_API_URL=https://api.wasender.dev/messages/text
DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE=91                       # prefixed to 10-digit local numbers
```

Then restart `php artisan queue:work` (a running worker keeps the old config).

## 4. Tests

```bash
cd backend
php artisan test
```

There are 71 tests (305 assertions). They cover login, logout, rate limiting and password changes; role-based access (a cashier gets 403 on inventory and settings, and even a role holding every permission can't reach settings); role and user management, admin password resets and self-lock-out protection; product create/edit, restocks and corrections (stock can never go negative), with every change in the stock log; the dashboard, notifications and private reminders; order creation, totals and rounding, insufficient stock, all-or-nothing rollback, validation, customer reuse, mobile-number lookup and normalisation, payment and change, order history, low-stock thresholds, both queued jobs (the WhatsApp API is faked with `Http::fake`), CORS, and a real multi-process concurrency test. `phpunit.xml` blanks the WhatsApp token and Resend key, so tests never send real messages.

> The tests use the MySQL database `store-order-inventory-system_testing` (set in `phpunit.xml`). The concurrency test needs MySQL, because SQLite silently ignores `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`. On any other driver the test skips itself.

## 5. API

Base URL: `http://localhost:8000/api`. Every response is JSON. A validation or stock failure returns `422` with Laravel's standard `{ message, errors }` shape.

**Authentication:** call `POST /login` with `{email, password}` to get a Sanctum token, then send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every other request. With no token or an expired one you get `401`; without the needed permission you get `403`. Tokens expire after 12 hours (`SANCTUM_EXPIRATION`, in minutes).

| Method | Endpoint | Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/login` | none (5 attempts/min) | Get a token + the user's permissions |
| `GET` / `POST` | `/me` · `/logout` | signed in | Current user & permissions · revoke this token |
| `PUT` | `/me/password` | signed in | Change own password (other sessions are signed out) |
| `GET` | `/dashboard` | `dashboard.view` | Sales stats, 7-day chart data, recent bills, stock summary, my reminders |
| `GET` | `/notifications` | signed in | Due/overdue reminders + low/out-of-stock alerts (stock alerts only with `products.view`) |
| `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE` | `/reminders` | signed in | Own reminders only |
| `POST` | `/orders` | `billing.create` | Create an order |
| `GET` | `/customers/lookup?email=` or `?phone=` | `billing.create` | Find a customer by email **or** mobile number (billing auto-fill) |
| `GET` | `/orders/{id}` | `orders.view` | Show one order |
| `GET` | `/customers/{email}/orders?page=&per_page=` | `orders.view` | A customer's order history, newest first (paginated) |
| `GET` | `/products` | `products.view` or `billing.create` | Catalog (also feeds the bill's product dropdown) |
| `GET` | `/products/low-stock?threshold=` | `products.view` | Products with stock **below** the threshold |
| `POST` / `PUT` | `/products` · `/products/{id}` | `products.manage` | Add a product (with opening stock) · edit details |
| `POST` | `/products/{id}/stock` | `stock.adjust` | `{type: restock\|correction, quantity (signed), note}` |
| `GET` | `/products/{id}/movements` | `products.view` | Stock log for a product |
| `GET` | `/permissions` | Admin | Permission catalogue, grouped |
| `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE` | `/roles`, `/users` | Admin | Manage roles and users |
| `PUT` | `/users/{id}/password` | Admin | Reset a user's password (signs them out everywhere) |

### Create order

```http
POST /api/orders
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "customer_email": "thomas@example.com",
  "customer_name": "Thomas Shelby",      // required only for a new customer
  "customer_phone": "98765 43210",       // optional; enables the WhatsApp bill
  "items": [
    { "product_id": 1, "quantity": 2 },
    { "product_id": 2, "quantity": 5 }
  ],
  "amount_paid": 250                      // optional
}
```

`201 Created`:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "order_number": "ORD-20260925-IXBC2Z",
    "customer": { "id": 1, "name": "Thomas Shelby", "email": "thomas@example.com" },
    "items": [
      { "product_id": 1, "product_name": "Colgate Toothpaste 100g", "quantity": 2,
        "unit_price": "50.00", "tax_percent": "18.00",
        "line_subtotal": "100.00", "line_tax": "18.00", "line_total": "118.00" },
      { "product_id": 2, "product_name": "Parle-G Biscuit", "quantity": 5,
        "unit_price": "10.00", "tax_percent": "5.00",
        "line_subtotal": "50.00", "line_tax": "2.50", "line_total": "52.50" }
    ],
    "subtotal": "150.00", "tax_total": "20.50", "grand_total": "170.50",
    "amount_paid": "250.00", "change_due": "79.50",
    "confirmation_sent_at": null,
    "created_at": "2026-09-25T17:56:47+00:00"
  }
}
```

Insufficient stock gives `422`, and the whole order is rejected:

```json
{
  "message": "Insufficient stock for one or more products.",
  "errors": { "items.0.quantity": ["Only 2 unit(s) of Eggs (12) in stock; 3 requested."] },
  "shortages": [{ "index": 0, "product_id": 5, "name": "Eggs (12)", "requested": 3, "available": 2 }]
}
```

## 6. How the frontend talks to the backend (CORS)

The React app (`localhost:5173`) and the API (`localhost:8000`) are on different origins, so the browser enforces CORS:

1. For a JSON `POST`, the browser first sends a preflight `OPTIONS /api/orders` with `Origin: http://localhost:5173`.
2. Laravel's built-in `HandleCors` middleware reads [backend/config/cors.php](backend/config/cors.php) and answers with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173`, plus the allowed methods and headers.
3. The browser then sends the real request. React reads the response.

The configuration:

- `allowed_origins` comes from `FRONTEND_URL` in `backend/.env`. It accepts a comma-separated list, e.g. for a deployed frontend. Only that origin is allowed; there is no `*`.
- `supports_credentials` is `false`. The API is stateless, with no cookies or sessions: the login token travels in the `Authorization` header, which is in `allowed_headers`.
- The token is kept in `localStorage`, so a page refresh keeps you signed in. An axios interceptor attaches it to every request. On any `401` (token expired or revoked, e.g. after an admin password reset) the app signs out and shows the login page. Trade-off: `localStorage` can be read by injected scripts (XSS). HttpOnly cookies via Sanctum's SPA mode would avoid that, but they need same-site hosting and CSRF handling, which is more than a two-origin dev setup needs.
- On the frontend, [frontend/src/api/client.js](frontend/src/api/client.js) is a single axios instance with `baseURL = VITE_API_URL`. It sends `Accept: application/json`, so Laravel always returns validation errors as JSON 422 instead of redirecting.
- Vite runs with `strictPort: true`, so the dev server can't silently move to another port that CORS would then block.

## 7. Design decisions

### Schema

```
roles (id, name UNIQUE, description, is_admin)          role_permissions (role_id FK, permission) PK(both)
users (…, role_id FK, is_active, last_login_at)
stock_movements (id, product_id FK, user_id FK NULL, order_id FK NULL, type, quantity ±, stock_after, note)
reminders (id, user_id FK, title, notes, due_at, completed_at NULL)
customers (id, name, email UNIQUE, phone NULL UNIQUE)
products  (id, name, code UNIQUE, price, tax_percent, stock UNSIGNED, INDEX stock)
orders    (id, order_number UNIQUE, customer_id FK, subtotal, tax_total, grand_total,
           created_by FK users NULL, amount_paid NULL, change_due NULL, confirmation_sent_at NULL, whatsapp_sent_at NULL,
           INDEX(customer_id, created_at))
order_items (id, order_id FK cascade, product_id FK restrict, unit_price, tax_percent, quantity,
             line_subtotal, line_tax, line_total, UNIQUE(order_id, product_id))
```

- **`order_items` is the supporting table.** It holds the many-to-many link between orders and products, plus per-line data.
- **Prices and tax are copied onto each line.** Changing a product's price or tax later must not rewrite old bills. A test covers this.
- **Totals are stored on `orders`.** They could be recomputed from the lines, but a bill is a financial record. Storing what was charged makes history reads cheap and keeps the record fixed.
- **`stock` is `UNSIGNED`.** This is the last line of defence: even buggy code can't push stock below zero.
- **Money uses `DECIMAL`, and all arithmetic uses integer paise** ([backend/app/Support/Money.php](backend/app/Support/Money.php)). This avoids float drift such as `0.1 + 0.2`.
- Deleting a product that has been sold is blocked (`restrictOnDelete`), so history never loses its lines.

### Code organisation

- **Controllers are thin.** They validate (via a Form Request), call a service and return an API Resource.
- **`OrderService::placeOrder()`** holds all the order logic: resolve the customer, lock the products, check stock, compute totals, save, deduct stock, then dispatch the job.
- **`StoreOrderRequest`** handles input validation, including rejecting duplicate products and requiring a name only for a new customer.
- **`InsufficientStockException`** renders itself as a 422 response in the same shape as a validation error, so the UI can put the message next to the right line.
- **API Resources** control the JSON shape, so internal columns never leak.

### Concurrency: no overselling

The check-and-deduct step runs inside one `DB::transaction()`:

```php
$products = Product::whereKey($ids)->orderBy('id')->lockForUpdate()->get();  // SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
// check stock -> create order + lines -> decrement stock
```

- `lockForUpdate()` takes an exclusive row lock. A second order for the same product blocks at this line until the first commits. It then reads the already-reduced stock and fails with a clean 422.
- Locks are taken in primary-key order, so two orders for overlapping products can't deadlock each other. `DB::transaction(..., attempts: 3)` retries if MySQL reports a deadlock anyway.
- Customers are created with `createOrFirst()`, so two first-time orders for the same email can't create duplicate customers.

**How it's proven:** `OrderConcurrencyTest` starts real, separate PHP processes (`php artisan orders:place …`). Each one opens its own database connection and goes through the same `OrderService` the API uses. To force the requests to overlap, rather than run one after another by chance, the test first holds the product's row lock itself. It starts all the processes, waits until they are queued behind that lock, then releases it so they compete at the same instant.

- Stock 1 with 2 buyers: exactly 1 order is placed and 1 is rejected.
- Stock 3 with 6 buyers: exactly 3 are placed, 3 are rejected, and stock ends at 0.

I checked that the test really catches the bug: with `lockForUpdate()` removed, the 6-buyer test fails. The losing requests get past the stock check and are only stopped by the unsigned column, as a 500 error rather than a clean rejection.

*Alternative considered:* a conditional atomic update, `UPDATE products SET stock = stock - ? WHERE id = ? AND stock >= ?`, checking the number of affected rows. It is lock-free and also correct. I chose pessimistic locking because a multi-line order needs to check every line before committing to any of them, and the lock makes that all-or-nothing logic easy to follow.

### Queued jobs (email + WhatsApp)

- **`SendOrderConfirmation`** (email) and **`SendOrderWhatsAppConfirmation`** both implement `ShouldQueue` and run on the `database` queue.
- Both are dispatched **after the transaction commits**, so an order that was rolled back never notifies anyone. The WhatsApp job is dispatched only when the customer has a mobile number.
- **They are two separate jobs on purpose.** If WhatsApp is down, its retries never re-send the email, and the other way round.
- **Email:** a real Mailable (`OrderConfirmationMail`, a Markdown template) sent through the configured mailer: `log` by default, `resend` once `RESEND_API_KEY` is set.
- **WhatsApp:** [`WasenderClient`](backend/app/Services/WhatsApp/WasenderClient.php) posts `{to, body}` (number without the `+`) with a Bearer token to wasender.dev's `/messages/text` endpoint; a 2xx means WhatsApp accepted it. The message is the itemised bill. A non-2xx response throws, so the queue retries. With no token set, the job logs a warning and skips.
- Both use `tries = 3` with backoff and are **idempotent**. Each sets its own timestamp (`confirmation_sent_at` / `whatsapp_sent_at`) and skips if it is already set, so a retry never sends twice.

### Mobile numbers

- **Stored in E.164** ([backend/app/Support/Phone.php](backend/app/Support/Phone.php)). `98765 43210`, `09876543210`, `919876543210` and `+91-98765-43210` all become `+919876543210`. That makes lookups match however the number was typed, and it is the format WhatsApp needs. Ten-digit numbers get `DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE` (91) added.
- **The phone is unique but optional.** Email stays the customer's identity, because the brief's order-history endpoint is keyed by email. The phone is a second way to find the same customer.

---

## 8. Assumptions

1. **Customer identity is the email** (lower-cased and trimmed, so `Thomas@Example.com` is the same customer). For an existing customer the submitted name is ignored. The saved name wins, and the UI makes the name field read-only once the email is recognised. A name is required only for a new customer.
2. **Tax is calculated per line and rounded half-up to the paisa**, then summed. For example, 3 × ₹9.99 at 5% gives tax ₹1.4985, which rounds to ₹1.50.
3. **An order is all-or-nothing.** If any line is short on stock, the whole order is rejected and nothing is deducted. A partial bill at a counter would confuse the customer.
4. **Each product may appear only once per order.** A duplicate `product_id` is a validation error; the client should raise the quantity instead. Quantity must be between 1 and 10,000, with at most 50 lines.
5. **"Below the threshold" is strict** (`stock < threshold`). The default is `LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD=10` in `.env` (read through `config/inventory.php`), and it can be overridden per request with `?threshold=`.
6. **"Amount given by customer" and "Balance to return"** from the wireframe are optional. If `amount_paid` is sent, the server checks it covers the grand total (otherwise 422) and stores the change. The note/coin breakdown (e.g. `1×₹20 + 1×₹2 + 80 paise`) is display-only and calculated in the browser.
7. **The wireframe's "emails PDF to customer"** is covered by the queued confirmation email containing the itemised bill. PDF generation was left out as outside the brief's scope ("a log entry or fake mailer is fine"). The bill can be printed from the browser.
8. **Every endpoint except `/login` requires sign-in,** including the brief's three order endpoints. A billing counter handles money and customer data, so anonymous access isn't reasonable.
    - **Access is permission-based:** roles are bundles of permissions from [backend/config/permissions.php](backend/config/permissions.php), each registered as a Gate ability and enforced by `can:` route middleware. The frontend hides menus the user can't use, but the server is the real gate.
    - **Settings is Admin-only by design:** it isn't an assignable permission, so no custom role can ever manage users or roles. The Admin role can't be edited or deleted, and admins can't deactivate or demote themselves.
    - **Password reset is admin-driven:** an admin sets a new password for the user from Settings, which signs them out everywhere, and users change their own from their profile. There is no self-service "forgot password" email, because the store has an admin on hand and email delivery (Resend) is optional in this setup.
    - **Deactivated users** are signed out immediately and can't sign in.
9. **Currency is INR (₹),** following the wireframe.
10. **Mobile number:** optional on an order and never a replacement for email.
    - If a new customer gives one, it is saved. If an existing customer gives a new or different one, their record is updated.
    - A number is never silently moved between customers, and billing is never blocked by a clash. If the form differs from the matched saved customer (e.g. Arun's mobile with a new email), **Generate bill** opens a dialog showing saved vs new details. The choices are *Update this customer & bill* (recommended; sends `customer_id` + `update_customer: true`, which saves the new email/name/mobile on that record, with uniqueness still enforced), or *Bill the new email without this mobile* / *Bill with saved details*. If the server spots a clash the form missed, its 422 names the owner (`conflict.customer`) and the same dialog appears.
    - On the billing screen, a known mobile fills in email and name, and a known email fills in mobile and name. Editing the field that matched clears the auto-filled values, so a typo can't bill the wrong person.
11. **The frontend shows a live total preview** using the same integer maths as the server. The server's figures on the returned bill are the authoritative ones.
12. **Stock changes only through audited paths.** Editing a product can't change its stock. Stock moves only through a sale, a restock (always +), a correction (+ or −, reason required) or the opening stock on create. Each change writes a `stock_movements` row with who made it, the signed quantity and the resulting level. Restocks use the same row lock as sales, so they can't race each other.
13. **Notifications are derived, not stored.** The bell shows current conditions: due or overdue reminders, and low or out-of-stock products. So an alert disappears by itself once the product is restocked or the reminder is completed. "Seen" state is kept per browser, only to clear the red badge.
14. **Reminders are personal** (each user sees only their own). "Due" means due by the end of today; overdue ones are highlighted.
15. **Times use `APP_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata`,** so "today's sales" and the 7-day chart follow the store's calendar day.

## 9. Frontend overview

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
Layout: a dark sidebar that collapses to icons on desktop (the choice is remembered) and slides in as a drawer on mobile. The top bar has the page title, the notification bell and the user menu (change password, sign out). Only the menu items your role allows are shown.

| Screen | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Login** (`/login`) | Email + password, show/hide password, demo-account shortcuts |
| **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) | Today's and this month's sales, product and restock counts, 7-day sales chart with hover details, recent bills, stock alerts with one-click restock, my reminders (tick to complete) |
| **New Bill** (`/billing`) | Mobile / email / name, with two-way auto-fill for returning customers, product rows with stock-aware dropdowns, live subtotal/tax/total, amount given → change with note breakdown, Generate Bill → printable bill. Server errors appear on the matching row. The Low Stock panel shows only for roles with inventory access. |
| **Receipt** (after Generate bill) | Thermal till receipt preview (store header, GSTIN, bill no, cashier, items, CGST/SGST summary, cash/change, QR of the bill number) with an **80 mm / 58 mm** switch (remembered) and **Print receipt**. Printing uses [react-to-print](https://github.com/MatthewHerbst/react-to-print) with `@page { size: 80mm auto; margin: 0 }`, so a thermal printer or "Save as PDF" gets a till slip, not an A4 sheet. Store details come from `VITE_STORE_*` in `frontend/.env`. |
| **Order History** (`/orders`) | Search by email, expandable orders with line items, pagination, email/WhatsApp status, and a **Receipt** button to preview and reprint any past bill |
| **Inventory** (`/inventory`) | All / Low-stock tabs (threshold can be changed), search, **Add product**, **Edit**, **Stock** (restock or correction with a live before → after preview), and a per-product **stock history** |
| **Reminders** (`/reminders`) | Pending / completed, add, edit, complete, delete |
| **Settings → Users** | Add users with a role, edit, deactivate, delete (admin only) |
| **Settings → Roles & Permissions** | Create or edit roles by ticking grouped permissions; Admin is locked |
| **Settings → Password Reset** | Set or generate a new password for any user |
| **My profile** (`/profile`) | Account details, permissions, change own password |

After each bill, stock change or reminder update, the affected lists and the notification bell refresh straight away. The bell also re-checks every 60 seconds.

## 10. AI-assisted development

This project was built with **Claude Code** (Anthropic) in VS Code. Screenshots of the prompts used are in [`/prompts`](prompts/).

Summary of how it was used:
1. Shared the task PDF and asked for a full plan first: prerequisites, every install command, and how the frontend connects to the backend (CORS). I reviewed the plan before any code was written.
2. Supplied the database credentials, which confirmed the plan. The AI then scaffolded both apps and wrote the code and tests.
3. Verification done during the session:
   - ran the full test suite;
   - mutation-checked the concurrency test by removing the lock and confirming the test fails;
   - curl-tested the CORS preflight and each endpoint;
   - ran the queue worker and confirmed the email in the log;
   - built and linted the frontend.
